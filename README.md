# Scrapper

This code takes a user input URL, makes a request to the website, and uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML. It then initializes empty lists for each file extension and finds all the links on the page. It then checks the file extension of each link and adds it to the appropriate list. Finally, it writes all the links to a text file, separating them by file extension.
